# EquiTrack
EquiTrack is a program used to update vaccine records for each horse at a farm. This will make it a lot easier for equine owners and barn owners to keep track of who is up to date on what vaccines. 
In this program, it will ask a series of questions to be sure that it is updating the right vaccine to the right horse and owner.
