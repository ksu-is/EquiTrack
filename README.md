# EquiTrack
EquiTrack is a Python based program used to update vaccine records for each horse at a farm. This will make it a lot easier for equine owners and barn owners to keep track of who is up to date on what vaccines. 
In this program, it will ask a series of questions to be sure that it is updating the right vaccine to the right horse and owner. 
While using this Python program, you will be able to view and change vaccine records by answering just a few short questions. Also, it will send you reminders for upcoming vaccines that your equine friend will need.
